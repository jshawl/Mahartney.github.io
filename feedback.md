# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Excellent job on your user stories! In the future, it would be nice to see some more evidence of your planning process,
like a Trello board with current, backlog, and icebox lists. Despite that, your comments in README.md are helpful! This will be useful to reference
before you go into project 2.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. I really like that the user can load/save decks or create their own! The code is quite complex, but I appreciate you looking
into third-party solutions like HTML5boilerplate. Just be sure to remove the code that you're not using to clean up your project.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. There are several global variables at play in your project, and it makes reading the code a little difficult / hard to keep
track of what's happening where. One recommendation I have - take a look in your code for things that are repeated and see if you can combine that
repeated code into a function you can call over and over.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. The comments in the readme are extremely helpful! In the future, I recommend starting with a very simple MVP - maybe
you create the deck and the user can only cycle through cards. Once that is working, you can refactor your code, and think about adding additional features.
Despite that, I am impressed with your project and would love to see you revisit this to clean up the code and make it more DRY. Happy to help if you need!
